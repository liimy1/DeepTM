# DeepTM
Prediction of protein melting temperatures directly from sequences.  
This version of DeepTM was used for the work described in the manuscript "Mengyu Li, Hongzhao Wang, Zhenwu Yang, Longgui Zhang, Yushan Zhu. DeepTM: A Deep Learning Algorithm for Prediction of Melting Temperature of Thermophilic Proteins Directly from Sequences.".  
The code for reproducing the results from the paper are available here. Some data can be downloaded at

 We have provided a [web server](http://deeptm.top/) where you can submit your protein sequence online for predicting the Tm value.
